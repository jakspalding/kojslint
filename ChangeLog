ChangeLog since kjslint 2.1.3:
- remove JSON2, use nsIJSON instead
- separate out jslint.js
- change per-file mode (jslint options) to global mode (each mode can be applied to multiple files)
- changed radio buttons to a select box for selection of mode
- a mode can be locked to prevent further changes (until it's unlocked)
