KoJSLint
========
Komodo (IDE/Editor) extension for integrating with [JSLint] and automatically fixing some common jslint warnings.

I'd like to thank Ben Smawfield for allowing me to fork [kjslint] to become this komodo extension.

  [JSLint]: http://www.jslint.com/
  [kjslint]: http://github.com/theSmaw/kJSLint

FEATURES
--------
- profiles of jslint options can be saved (called mode) which are available for all files/projects
- add/delete profiles (modes)
- auto-fix some common jslint warnings
- all jslint warnings on the same line are grouped in the "JSLint errors" output tab
- profiles can be locked (it can't be changed/deleted until being unlocked)

AutoFix
-------
To access the AutoFix feature, right click on a row in the "JSLint errors" output tab to auto fix that particular warning. If you are auto-fixing multiple warnings on the same line, try to begin with the last warning for that particular line, and move backward.
